Influential members of the House [D1] [SS] Ways [ES] and [SS] Means [ES] [D1]  Committee introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings-and-loan bailout agency can raise capital , creating another potential obstacle to the government 's sale of sick thrifts .
The bill , whose backers include Chairman Dan Rostenkowski -LRB- D. , Ill. -RRB- , would prevent the Resolution Trust Corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an RTC-owned [D1] [SS] bank [ES] or [SS] thrift issue debt [ES] [D1]  that would n't be counted on the federal budget .
Such agency self-help borrowing is [D1] [SS] unauthorized [ES] and [SS] expensive [ES] [D1]  , far more expensive than direct Treasury borrowing , said Rep. Fortney Stark -LRB- D. , Calif. -RRB- , the bill 's chief sponsor .
That debt would be paid off as the assets are sold , leaving the total spending for the bailout at [D1] [SS] $ 50 billion [ES] , or [SS] $ 166 billion including interest over 10 years [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] The agency has already spent roughly $ 19 billion selling 34 insolvent S&Ls [ES] , and [SS] it is likely to [D2] [SS] sell [ES] or [SS] merge [ES] [D2]  600 by the time the bailout concludes [ES] [D1]  .
Moreover , [D1] [SS] it says the RTC 's total obligations may not exceed $ 50 billion [ES] , but [SS] that figure is derived after [D2] [SS] including [D3] [SS] notes [ES] and [SS] other debt [ES] [D3]  [ES] , and [SS] subtracting from it the market value of the assets the RTC holds [ES] [D2]  [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] But Congress did n't [D2] [SS] anticipate [ES] or [SS] intend [ES] [D2]  more public debt , say opponents of the RTC 's working-capital plan [ES] , and [SS] Rep. Charles Schumer -LRB- D. , N.Y . -RRB- said the RTC Oversight Board has been remiss in not keeping Congress informed [ES] [D1]  .
That secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from [D1] [SS] Ways [ES] and [SS] Means [ES] [D1]  , which seems to me sort of draconian , he said .
The [D1] [SS] Ways [ES] and [SS] Means [ES] [D1]  Committee will hold a hearing on the bill next Tuesday .
Hard on the heels of [D1] [SS] Friday 's 190-point stock-market plunge [ES] and [SS] the uncertainty that 's followed [ES] [D1]  , a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads trumpeting a familiar message : Keep on investing , the market 's just fine .
PaineWebber Inc. [D1] [SS] filmed a new television commercial at 4 p.m. EDT yesterday [ES] and [SS] had it on the air by last night [ES] [D1]  .
Fidelity Investments [D1] [SS] placed new ads in newspapers yesterday [ES] , and [SS] wrote another new ad appearing today [ES] [D1]  .
It [D1] [SS] considered running them during tomorrow night 's World Series broadcast [ES] but [SS] decided not to when the market recovered yesterday [ES] [D1]  .
The brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around , when frightened investors [D1] [SS] flooded the phone lines [ES] and [SS] fled the market in a panic [ES] [D1]  .
A Fidelity spokesman says the 800-line , [D1] [SS] which already was operating [ES] but [SS] which many clients did n't know about [ES] [D1]  , received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend .
Today 's Fidelity ad goes a step further , encouraging investors [D1] [SS] to stay in the market [ES] or [SS] even to plunge in with Fidelity [ES] [D1]  .
In the aftermath of the 1987 debacle , the brokerage firm began taping commercials in-house , ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to [D1] [SS] tape a commercial after the market closed [ES] and [SS] rush it on the air that night [ES] [D1]  .
We 're saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market [D1] [SS] go down [ES] and [SS] dump everything [ES] [D1]  , which just drives the prices down further , says John Lampe , PaineWebber 's director of advertising .
If you [D1] [SS] owned it [ES] and [SS] liked it [ES] [D1]  Friday , the true value has n't changed .
With the market [D1] [SS] fluctuating [ES] and [SS] then closing up more than 88 points [ES] [D1]  yesterday , investment firms had to constantly revise their approach .
At Shearson Lehman , executives created potential new commercials [D1] [SS] Friday night [ES] and [SS] throughout the weekend [ES] [D1]  , then had to regroup yesterday afternoon .
Mr. Eskandarian , who resigned his Della Femina post in September , becomes [D1] [SS] chairman [ES] and [SS] chief executive [ES] [D1]  of Arnold .
John Verret , the agency 's [D1] [SS] president [ES] and [SS] chief executive [ES] [D1]  , will retain the title of president .
The supplement , the largest ever for the magazine , [D1] [SS] includes ads from 52 corporate advertisers [ES] and [SS] kicks off a two-year Business Week initiative on education [ES] [D1]  .
It 's what [D1] [SS] 1 -RRB- explains why we are like , well , ourselves rather than Bo Jackson [ES] ; [SS] 2 -RRB- cautions that it 's possible to drown in a lake that averages two feet deep [ES] ; and [SS] 3 -RRB- predicts that 10,000 monkeys placed before 10,000 pianos would produce 1,118 publishable rock 'n' roll tunes [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] Baseball , that game of the long haul , is the quintessential sport of the mean [ES] , and [SS] the mean ol' law caught up with the San Francisco Giants in the World Series last weekend [ES] [D1]  .
The team that dumped runs by the bushel on the Chicago Cubs in the National League playoffs was held to just one in two games by the home-team Oakland A 's , the gang that had been done unto similarly by [D1] [SS] the Los Angeles Dodgers [ES] and [SS] Orel Hershiser [ES] [D1]  in last year 's tournament .
So what if Steinbach had [D1] [SS] struck just seven home runs in 130 regular-season games [ES] , and [SS] batted in the seventh position of the A 's lineup [ES] [D1]  .
If you [D1] [SS] get your pitch [ES] , and [SS] take a good swing [ES] [D1]  , anything can happen , he later remarked .
On Saturday night , quite a few of the boys in [D1] [SS] green [ES] and [SS] gold [ES] [D1]  salted away successes to salve the pain of [D1] [SS] past [ES] and , no doubt , [SS] future [ES] [D1]  droughts .
The A-men batting Nos. 6 through 9 , a.k.a. the bottom of the order , [D1] [SS] got seven of their team 's 11 hits [ES] and [SS] scored four of its runs in a 5-0 decision [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] That he was the A 's winningest pitcher during its American League campaign with a 21-9 mark , plus two wins over Toronto in the playoffs , indicates he may have some evening up coming [ES] , but [SS] with the way his split-fingered fastball is behaving , that might not be this week [ES] [D1]  .
The same goes for Mike Moore , another veteran who overcame early struggles to permit the Giants but [D1] [SS] a run [ES] and [SS] four hits [ES] [D1]  in seven innings in Sunday 's contest .
[D1] [SS] One might think that the home fans in this Series of the Subway Called BART -LRB- that 's a better name for a public conveyance than Desire , do n't you think ? -RRB- would have been ecstatic over the proceedings [ES] , but [SS] they observe them in relative calm [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] Partisans of the two combatants sat side by side in the 49,000-plus seats of Oakland Coliseum [ES] , and [SS] while they [D2] [SS] cheered their favorites [ES] and [SS] booed the opposition [ES] [D2]  , hostilities advanced no further , at least as far as I could see [ES] [D1]  .
A few folks even showed up wearing caps bearing the [D1] [SS] colors [ES] and [SS] emblems [ES] [D1]  of both teams .
I [D1] [SS] 'm for the Giants today [ES] , but [SS] only because they lost yesterday [ES] [D1]  .
The above represents a triumph of either [D1] [SS] apathy [ES] or [SS] civility [ES] [D1]  .
I choose to believe it 's the latter , although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here , including the [D1] [SS] A 's [ES] and [SS] Giants [ES] [D1]  , is originally from somewhere else .
Suffice it to say that if this were [D1] [SS] a New York Yankees-Mets series [ES] , or [SS] one between the [D2] [SS] Chicago Cubs [ES] and [SS] White Sox [ES] [D2]  -LRB- hey , it 's possible -RRB- [ES] [D1]  , [D1] [SS] you 'd need uniformed police in every other seat to separate opposing fans [ES] , and [SS] only the suicidal would bifurcate their bonnets [ES] [D1]  .
In the opening game , besides [D1] [SS] Steinbach [ES] and [SS] Stewart [ES] [D1]  , there was Walt Weiss , a twiggy-looking , second-year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery .
He [D1] [SS] was flawless afield -LRB- ditto in game two -RRB- , moved a runner along in the A 's three-run second inning [ES] , and [SS] homered for his team 's final tally [ES] [D1]  .
He [D1] [SS] smoked Toronto in the playoffs with [D2] [SS] six hits [ES] , [SS] seven walks [ES] and [SS] eight stolen bases [ES] [D2]  in 22 at bats [ES] , and [SS] continued that by going 3-for-3 at the plate Sunday , along with [D2] [SS] walking [ES] , [SS] stealing a base [ES] and [SS] scoring a run [ES] [D2]  [ES] [D1]  .
The cold guys in the set were [D1] [SS] Will Clark [ES] , [SS] Kevin Mitchell [ES] and [SS] Matt Williams [ES] [D1]  , the Giants ' 3-4-5 hitters .
They combined for [D1] [SS] 25 hits [ES] , [SS] six home runs [ES] and [SS] 24 runs batted in [ES] [D1]  in the five games against the Cubs .
They went a collective 5-for-24 here , with zero [D1] [SS] homers [ES] and [SS] ribbies [ES] [D1]  .
The computer maker , which sells more than half its goods outside the U.S. , also said the negative effect of a stronger U.S. dollar will [D1] [SS] adversely affect its fourth-quarter performance [ES] and [SS] make it difficult to better 1988 results [ES] [D1]  .
NCR said revenue declined both [D1] [SS] in the U.S. [ES] and [SS] overseas [ES] [D1]  , reflecting a world-wide softening of the computer markets .
In addition to a general slowing of the computer industry , NCR , which sells [D1] [SS] automated teller machines [ES] and [SS] computerized cash registers [ES] [D1]  , is also affected by the [D1] [SS] retail [ES] and [SS] financial [ES] [D1]  sectors , areas of the economy that have generally not been robust , notes Sanjiv G. Hingorani , an analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc .
In the year-earlier fourth quarter , NCR had profit of [D1] [SS] $ 149.6 million [ES] , or [SS] $ 1.85 a share [ES] [D1]  , on revenue of $ 1.8 billion .
Last year , NCR had net income of [D1] [SS] $ 439.3 million [ES] , or [SS] $ 5.33 a share [ES] [D1]  , on $ 5.99 billion in revenue .
For the nine months , the company 's earnings fell 9 % to [D1] [SS] $ 264.6 million [ES] , or [SS] $ 3.40 a share [ES] [D1]  , from [D1] [SS] $ 289.7 million [ES] , or [SS] $ 3.49 a share [ES] [D1]  .
Why not [D1] [SS] extend the same harsh standards to the sales force [ES] , and [SS] pay brokers a base salary with annual bonus based on how much money they made for their clients during the year [ES] [D1]  ?
That should [D1] [SS] stop a lot of account-churning [ES] , and [SS] produce a stock market driven only by [D2] [SS] professional concern [ES] , [SS] careful thought [ES] and [SS] good sense [ES] [D2]  [ES] [D1]  .
Steve Clark , a Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. trader , reported for work at 5 a.m. , [D1] [SS] two [ES] and [SS] a half [ES] [D1]  hours before the usual Monday morning strategy meeting .
At Jefferies & Co. , [D1] [SS] J. Francis Palamara did n't reach the office until 5:30 a.m. [ES] , but then [SS] he had been up most of the night at home [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] People are looking for possible opportunities to buy [ES] , but [SS] nobody wants to stick their chin out [ES] [D1]  .
Tokyo stocks closed off a [D1] [SS] significant [ES] but [SS] less-than-alarming [ES] [D1]  1.8 % on thin volume ; Hong Kong stocks declined 6.5 % in orderly trading .
Right away , the reds outnumbered the blues , 80 to 20 , as the index opened at 2076.8 , off [D1] [SS] 157.1 points [ES] , or [SS] 7 % [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] I see concern [ES] , but [SS] I do n't see any panic [ES] [D1]  , said Mr. Palamara , a big , good-humored New York native who runs the 15-trader office .
[D1] [SS] Jefferies spent most of its energies in the morning trying to match [D2] [SS] buyers [ES] and [SS] sellers [ES] [D2]  [ES] , and [SS] there were n't many buyers [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] On the screens , only two forlorn blue figures remained [ES] , but [SS] the index [D2] [SS] had recovered a few points [ES] and [SS] was off about 140 [ES] [D2]  [ES] [D1]  .
He [D1] [SS] targeted 7,500 shares of Reuters [ES] and [SS] punched a button to call up on his screen other dealers ' price quotes [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] The vivid yellow figures showed the best price at 845 pence , -LRB- $ 13.27 -RRB- [ES] and [SS] Mr. Smith 's traders started putting out feelers [ES] [D1]  .
But [D1] [SS] the market sensed a serious buyer on a day dominated by selling [ES] , and [SS] the quotes immediately jumped to 850 pence [ES] [D1]  .
By this time , [D1] [SS] it was 4:30 a.m. in New York [ES] , and [SS] Mr. Smith fielded a call from a New York customer wanting an opinion on the British stock market , which had been having troubles of its own even before Friday 's New York market break [ES] [D1]  .
Spain is [D1] [SS] down 10 % [ES] and [SS] suspended [ES] [D1]  , Sweden 's down 8 % , Norway 11 % .
As 2:30 p.m. -- Wall Street 's opening time -- neared , Shearson [D1] [SS] traders [ES] and [SS] salesmen [ES] [D1]  traded bets on how low the New York market would open .
In the center of the trading floor , [D1] [SS] chief trader Roger Streeter [ES] and [SS] two colleagues [ES] [D1]  scrambled for the telephones as soon as the New York market opened -- plummeting more than 60 points in the first few minutes .
As Wall Street traders dumped American Depositary Receipts in Jaguar PLC , [D1] [SS] Mr. Streeter [ES] and [SS] trader Sam Ruiz [ES] [D1]  bought them to resell in the U.K .
Investors here still expect [D1] [SS] Ford Motor Co. [ES] or [SS] General Motors Corp. [ES] [D1]  to bid for Jaguar .
As the London market rallied , some wondered whether the weekend of [D1] [SS] worrying [ES] and [SS] jitters [ES] [D1]  had been worth it .
The London index closed at 2163.4 , its high for the day , off [D1] [SS] 70.5 [ES] , or [SS] about 3.3 % [ES] [D1]  .
The House Aviation Subcommittee approved a bill that would give the transportation secretary authority to [D1] [SS] review [ES] and [SS] approve [ES] [D1]  leveraged buy-outs of major U.S. airlines .
The collapsed plan to acquire UAL Corp. , parent of United Airlines , spurred quick action on the legislation , [D1] [SS] introduced Wednesday [ES] and [SS] approved by the subcommittee on a voice vote yesterday [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] The bill is expected to be taken up by the Public [D2] [SS] Works [ES] and [SS] Transportation [ES] [D2]  Committee tomorrow [ES] , and [SS] a floor vote by next week will be urged [ES] [D1]  .
The measure drew [D1] [SS] criticism from the Bush administration [ES] and [SS] a parting shot from financier Donald Trump , who yesterday withdrew his takeover bid for AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines [ES] [D1]  .
In a letter to subcommittee Chairman James Oberstar -LRB- D. , Minn. -RRB- , Mr. Trump [D1] [SS] criticized the bill as an explicit effort to thwart his bid for AMR [ES] , and [SS] said it contributed to the collapse of the deal [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] Mr. Oberstar [ES] and [SS] other committee members [ES] [D1]  repeatedly stressed that the legislation was n't a response to any particular market situation .
But they cited the [D1] [SS] UAL [ES] and [SS] AMR [ES] [D1]  examples as reasons to move quickly to enact this legislation .
Aides both in the [D1] [SS] House [ES] and [SS] Senate [ES] [D1]  said the withdrawal of the Trump bid for AMR is n't likely to deflate efforts to push the legislation .
[D1] [SS] It 's still on the fast track [ES] and [SS] we still want to do it [ES] [D1]  , said one Senate aide .
Currently , the transportation secretary [D1] [SS] does n't have clearly established authority to block mergers [ES] , but [SS] can take the drastic step of revoking the operating certificate of any carrier the official considers unfit [ES] [D1]  .
Supporters of the legislation view the bill as an effort [D1] [SS] to add [D2] [SS] stability [ES] and [SS] certainty [ES] [D2]  to the airline-acquisition process [ES] , and [SS] to preserve the [D2] [SS] safety [ES] and [SS] fitness [ES] [D2]  of the industry [ES] [D1]  .
It also would require the acquiring party [D1] [SS] to notify the transportation secretary [ES] and [SS] to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition [ES] [D1]  .
The bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy-out [D1] [SS] if sufficient information has n't been provided [ES] , or [SS] if the buy-out is likely to [D2] [SS] weaken the carrier financially , result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets [ES] , or [SS] give control to a foreign interest [ES] [D2]  [ES] [D1]  .
All the witnesses , both [D1] [SS] congressmen [ES] and [SS] industry experts [ES] [D1]  , expressed support for the bill in order to prevent profiteers from cashing in on airline profits at the expense of safe , cost-effective service .
But several committee members disapproved , some backing Mr. Trump 's claim that the threat of regulation caused [D1] [SS] the failure of the UAL deal [ES] and [SS] the stock-market plunge [ES] [D1]  .
One of the major concerns expressed by the dissenters was that large airlines would be prohibited from [D1] [SS] divesting themselves of smaller entities [ES] and [SS] producing independent spin-off companies [ES] [D1]  .
In a possible prelude to the resumption of talks between [D1] [SS] Boeing Co. [ES] and [SS] striking Machinists union members [ES] [D1]  , a federal mediator said representatives of the two sides will meet with him tomorrow .
[D1] [SS] It could be a long meeting [ES] or [SS] it could be a short one [ES] [D1]  , said Doug Hammond , the mediator , who called the agreement to meet a first step toward a resumption of negotiations .
[D1] [SS] We 're encouraged that talks are scheduled again [ES] but [SS] beyond that , we have made no expression of expectations [ES] [D1]  , a Boeing spokesman said .
Now in its 13th day , the strike [D1] [SS] has idled about 55,000 machinists [ES] and [SS] has started to delay delivery of some jetliners [ES] [D1]  .
Work at Boeing continues with [D1] [SS] supervisors [ES] and [SS] other non-striking personnel [ES] [D1]  manning the lines .
DPC , a group led by the New York investment firm Crescott Inc. , also said it plans to file preliminary materials with the [D1] [SS] Securities [ES] and [SS] Exchange [ES] [D1]  Commission regarding a shareholder solicitation to oust Dataproducts ' board .
[D1] [SS] DPC [D2] [SS] holds a 7.8 % stake in Dataproducts [ES] and [SS] made a $ 15-a-share bid for the company in May [ES] [D2]  [ES] , but [SS] Dataproducts management considered the $ 283.7 million proposal unacceptable [ES] [D1]  .
Dataproducts , which had been seeking a buyer for several months , [D1] [SS] announced a restructuring plan in September [ES] and [SS] took itself off the auction block [ES] [D1]  .
The company 's restructuring includes plans [D1] [SS] to split into three sectors [ES] , [SS] to phase out domestic printer manufacturing operations [ES] and [SS] to sell its New England subsidiary [ES] [D1]  .
Jack Davis , Dataproducts ' [D1] [SS] president [ES] , [SS] chairman [ES] and [SS] chief executive officer [ES] [D1]  , said the company is at a loss to understand DPC 's intentions .
He [D1] [SS] called today 's announcement [D2] [SS] opportunistic [ES] and [SS] disruptive [ES] [D2]  [ES] and [SS] said the company intends to proceed with its restructuring [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] Share prices plummeted across Europe yesterday in response to Friday 's New York sell-off [ES] , but [SS] some issues staged a late comeback after Wall Street opened without another rout [ES] [D1]  .
In London , prices [D1] [SS] plummeted in early trading [ES] and [SS] were off as much as 9 % before coming back strong after the New York opening to close down only 3.2 % [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] There may be [D2] [SS] one [ES] or [SS] other [ES] [D2]  [D2] [SS] psychological [ES] or [SS] technical [ES] [D2]  reactions [ES] , but [SS] they are n't based on fundamentals [ES] [D1]  .
The economy of [D1] [SS] West Germany [ES] and [SS] the EC -LCB- European Community -RCB- [ES] [D1]  is highly stable .
Share prices fell in [D1] [SS] Milan [ES] , [SS] Amsterdam [ES] , [SS] Zurich [ES] , [SS] Madrid [ES] and [SS] Stockholm [ES] [D1]  .
Investors may have reacted so strongly to Friday 's U.S. stock market loss because they had vivid memories of the Frankfurt exchange 's losing 35 % of its value in [D1] [SS] the 1987 crash [ES] and [SS] its wake [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] Institutional investors [ES] and [SS] bankers [ES] [D1]  , many of whom spent the night before in their offices watching Far Eastern markets , were cautiously optimistic after the mild 1.8 % decline in Tokyo stock prices .
[D1] [SS] Some big institutions , including banks , began picking up lower-priced shares late yesterday [ES] , but [SS] most investors wanted to see what would happen in New York before acting [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] A 16.3 % drop for Mannesmann AG [ES] and [SS] Dresdner Bank AG 's 9.6 % decline [ES] [D1]  were especially problematic for their respective boards , whose plans for major rights issues in November could now be in jeopardy .
It was big institutions such as [D1] [SS] Norwich Union Insurance Group [ES] , [SS] Scottish Amicable Investment Managers [ES] and [SS] Standard Life Assurance Co. [ES] [D1]  that spearheaded the rally .
[D1] [SS] Attracted by low prices [ES] and [SS] encouraged by New York 's performance [ES] [D1]  , they scooped up equities across the board .
Trading was driven primarily by small [D1] [SS] investors [ES] and [SS] speculators [ES] [D1]  , with large institutions waiting on the sidelines until late in the day .
J.P. Morgan & Co. swung to a loss in the third quarter , while [D1] [SS] NCNB Corp. reported net income more than doubled [ES] , and [SS] Security Pacific Corp. net rose 10 % [ES] [D1]  .
The reserve addition placed the parent of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. among a few major U.S. banks that have covered nearly all their [D1] [SS] medium [ES] and [SS] long-term [ES] [D1]  portfolios to less-developed countries with reserves .
In the year-earlier quarter , Morgan earned [D1] [SS] $ 233.6 million [ES] , or [SS] $ 1.25 a share [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] Excluding the $ 2 billion provision [ES] and [SS] allowing for the taxes Morgan paid [ES] [D1]  , earnings were about 65 cents a share , Mr. Salem said .
Morgan received $ 2 million of interest payments on its [D1] [SS] medium [ES] and [SS] long-term [ES] [D1]  Brazilian loans ; had they been accruing interest , net interest income would have been $ 35 million higher in the quarter , Morgan said .
Income from sources other than interest climbed 12 % to $ 414 million , reflecting [D1] [SS] higher [D2] [SS] corporate-finance [ES] and [SS] other [ES] [D2]  fees [ES] and [SS] gains on sales of investment securities [ES] [D1]  .
The Charlotte , N.C. , company said earnings rose to [D1] [SS] $ 143.6 million [ES] , or [SS] $ 1.45 a share [ES] [D1]  , from [D1] [SS] $ 58.9 million [ES] , or [SS] 69 cents a share [ES] [D1]  , a year earlier .
The latest quarter included a gain of [D1] [SS] $ 56.1 million [ES] , or [SS] 59 cents a share [ES] [D1]  , related to the purchase of the remaining 51 % of NCNB Texas National Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
In the third quarter , nonperforming assets jumped to [D1] [SS] $ 474.1 million [ES] , or [SS] 1.43 % of net [D2] [SS] loans [ES] and [SS] leases [ES] [D2]  [ES] [D1]  , from [D1] [SS] $ 232.8 million [ES] , or [SS] 1.13 % [ES] [D1]  in the second quarter .
Nonperformers totaled [D1] [SS] $ 230.8 million [ES] , or [SS] 1.27 % [ES] [D1]  in the year-ago third quarter .
NCNB raised some $ 1.9 billion in new capital during the quarter [D1] [SS] to complete the NCNB Texas purchase [ES] , and [SS] to acquire several small failed thrifts to fill out its regional franchise [ES] [D1]  .
Last week , the banking company said it purchased both [D1] [SS] Freedom Savings & Loan Association , Tampa , Fla. , [ES] and [SS] University Federal Savings Association of San Antonio , Texas , [ES] [D1]  for $ 169.4 million .
In the first nine months , NCNB 's net income climbed 65 % to [D1] [SS] $ 310.9 million [ES] , or [SS] $ 3.30 a share [ES] [D1]  , from [D1] [SS] $ 188.2 million [ES] , or [SS] $ 2.22 a share [ES] [D1]  , a year earlier .
[D1] [SS] Security Pacific 's earnings growth slowed in the third quarter [ES] , but [SS] the Los Angeles bank holding company was still able to post a 10 % increase in net income because of robust growth in residential [D2] [SS] real-estate [ES] and [SS] consumer loans [ES] [D2]  [ES] [D1]  .
Net rose to [D1] [SS] $ 185.1 million [ES] , or [SS] $ 1.55 a share [ES] [D1]  , from [D1] [SS] $ 167.9 million [ES] , or [SS] $ 1.47 a share [ES] [D1]  , a year earlier .
The company said the gain resulted mainly from a $ 54 million increase in net interest income , reflecting [D1] [SS] a 33 % increase in real estate loans -LRB- mainly residential -RRB- [ES] , and [SS] a 19 % rise in consumer loans [ES] [D1]  .
The earnings represent [D1] [SS] a 0.89 % return on assets for Security Pacific [ES] , and [SS] an 18.9 % return on equity [ES] [D1]  .
Security Pacific 's loan-loss provision was down [D1] [SS] 22 % [ES] , or [SS] $ 30.4 million [ES] [D1]  , because it added to its foreign-debt reserve the year before .
For the nine months , net rose 17 % to [D1] [SS] $ 548.9 million [ES] , or [SS] $ 4.67 a share [ES] [D1]  , from [D1] [SS] $ 469.4 million [ES] , or [SS] $ 4.13 a share [ES] [D1]  , a year earlier .
LIN Broadcasting Corp. said it [D1] [SS] wo n't take a position on a revised tender offer by McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. to buy LIN [ES] and [SS] has asked for clarification of the offer [ES] [D1]  .
The new offer , which seeks 50.3 % of the [D1] [SS] cellular [ES] and [SS] broadcasting [ES] [D1]  concern , is for $ 125 a share for 22 million LIN shares .
LIN is asking McCaw to clarify its tender offer , which challenges an agreement between [D1] [SS] BellSouth Corp. [ES] and [SS] LIN [ES] [D1]  to merge their cellular-telephone businesses .
BellSouth has notified LIN that it would shortly respond to the McCaw proposal in as [D1] [SS] full [ES] and [SS] effective [ES] [D1]  a manner as is warranted .
[D1] [SS] McCaw has no obligation to purchase [ES] and [SS] the definition of private market value is uncertain [ES] [D1]  , the LIN board said .
The board added that McCaw [D1] [SS] would be able to control LIN 's operations [ES] and [SS] could , therefore , operate LIN in a manner which could diminish [D2] [SS] its private market value [ES] and [SS] attractiveness to a third-party purchaser [ES] [D2]  in five years [ES] [D1]  .
In a letter filed with the [D1] [SS] Securities [ES] and [SS] Exchange [ES] [D1]  Commission , the group , which holds [D1] [SS] about 4.5 million Telerate shares [ES] , or [SS] about 4.7 % of the shares outstanding [ES] [D1]  , said ... at present [D1] [SS] none of us believes an offer for less than $ 25 per share would be fair [ES] and [SS] some believe that $ 25 is too low [ES] [D1]  .
Dow Jones , publisher of The Wall Street Journal , has launched an [D1] [SS] $ 18-a-share [ES] , or [SS] $ 576 million [ES] [D1]  , tender offer to acquire the remaining Telerate shares outstanding ; Dow Jones owns 67 % of Telerate .
The group includes [D1] [SS] [D2] [SS] Putnam Cos. [ES] and [SS] various affiliates based in Boston [ES] [D2]  [ES] ; [SS] Wells Fargo Bank , San Francisco [ES] ; [SS] the California Public Employees Retirement System , Sacramento , Calif. [ES] , and [SS] T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. , Baltimore [ES] [D1]  .
A spokesman for Dow Jones [D1] [SS] said he had n't seen the group 's filing [ES] , but [SS] added , obviously Dow Jones disagrees with their conclusions [ES] [D1]  .
Our offer is to buy [D1] [SS] any [ES] and [SS] all [ES] [D1]  shares tendered at $ 18 a share .
U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said the first dispute-settlement panel set up under the U.S.-Canadian free trade agreement has ruled that Canada 's restrictions on exports of [D1] [SS] Pacific salmon [ES] and [SS] herring [ES] [D1]  violate the accord .
Mrs. Hills said [D1] [SS] the U.S. [ES] and [SS] Canada [ES] [D1]  have until Nov. 13 to resolve the dispute .
If a solution is n't reached by then , she said , the U.S. would have the right to suspend some trade concessions to Canada equivalent in value to the losses suffered by U.S. fish-processing companies in [D1] [SS] Alaska [ES] and [SS] the Pacific Northwest [ES] [D1]  .
However , in Ottawa , Canadian Trade Minister John Crosbie said the dispute-settlement panel accepted the legitimacy of Canada 's position on the use of these landing requirements to [D1] [SS] conserve [ES] and [SS] manage [ES] [D1]  these important fisheries .
Questioned about the seeming contradiction in the [D1] [SS] U.S. [ES] and [SS] Canadian [ES] [D1]  government views of the panel 's report , an aide for Mrs. Hills said the panel had clearly ruled that the Canadian trade restrictions are illegal .
Earlier , an international panel set up under the rules of the General Agreement on [D1] [SS] Tariffs [ES] and [SS] Trade [ES] [D1]  in Geneva determined that the original Canadian fish-export restrictions violated GATT rules .
BancOklahoma Corp. said it completed a restructuring agreement previously agreed to by [D1] [SS] the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. [ES] , [SS] creditor banks [ES] and [SS] subordinated debenture holders [ES] [D1]  .
The plan would permit the bank holding company to retire its [D1] [SS] bank [ES] and [SS] debenture [ES] [D1]  obligations through exchanges of [D1] [SS] cash [ES] and [SS] equity [ES] [D1]  .
In exchange for the $ 76 million they are owed , creditor banks will receive [D1] [SS] 3.9 million shares of BancOklahoma common stock [ES] and [SS] the proceeds from the future sales of four subsidiary banks to private buyers [ES] [D1]  , the bank holding company said .
Also under the agreement , [D1] [SS] debenture holders will get one million shares of common stock in exchange for $ 7.7 million in debentures [ES] and [SS] holders of BancOklahoma 's series A preferred stock will receive 1.25 shares of common stock for every share of preferred they own [ES] [D1]  , the company said .
BSN Corp. said it will begin an offer tomorrow to exchange [D1] [SS] up to one million of its common shares [ES] and [SS] all of its $ 16.6 million in 7 3\/4 % convertible debentures due 2001 [ES] [D1]  for a package of new [D1] [SS] debt [ES] and [SS] common stock warrants [ES] [D1]  .
Under terms of the offer , the sporting goods maker will swap [D1] [SS] $ 9 face amount of 9 1\/4 % subordinated notes due 1996 [ES] and [SS] one warrant [ES] [D1]  for each common share .
BSN also is offering [D1] [SS] $ 850 face amount of new notes [ES] and [SS] 64 common-stock warrants [ES] [D1]  for each $ 1,000 face amount of its convertible debt outstanding .
The offer is n't contingent on a certain amount of [D1] [SS] debt [ES] or [SS] stock [ES] [D1]  being exchanged .
BSN said it is making the offer to [D1] [SS] shrink its capital [ES] and [SS] increase shareholder value [ES] [D1]  .
If all the [D1] [SS] bondholders [ES] and [SS] holders [ES] [D1]  of one million common shares accept the offer , [D1] [SS] BSN will increase its debt by $ 9 million [ES] , but [SS] it also will recognize a $ 2 million gain from retiring the old debt [ES] [D1]  , said Michael J. Blumenfeld , president .
Merrill Lynch & Co. 's net income dropped 37 % , while [D1] [SS] Bear Stearns Cos. posted a 7.5 % gain in net [ES] , and [SS] PaineWebber Group Inc. 's profit [D2] [SS] fell [ES] , but [SS] would have risen without a special gain a year ago [ES] [D2]  [ES] [D1]  .
At Merrill Lynch , third-period net was [D1] [SS] $ 41 million [ES] , or [SS] 34 cents a share [ES] [D1]  , down from [D1] [SS] $ 65.6 million [ES] , or [SS] 58 cents a share [ES] [D1]  , a year ago .
Investment banking revenue fell 22 % to $ 296.6 million on fewer [D1] [SS] equity [ES] and [SS] municipal [ES] [D1]  underwritings .
Merrill Lynch 's commission revenue grew 21 % , however , to $ 462.8 million , [D1] [SS] on higher [D2] [SS] share prices [ES] and [SS] volume [ES] [D2]  [ES] and [SS] on strong sales of mutual funds [ES] [D1]  .
Revenue derived from [D1] [SS] interest [ES] and [SS] dividends [ES] [D1]  jumped 30 % to $ 1.4 billion .
The brokerage also reported a loss of $ 2.2 million from the discontinued [D1] [SS] operations [ES] and [SS] disposal [ES] [D1]  of its Fine Homes International Limited Partnership real-estate subsidiary .
Bear Stearns said net in the first quarter ended Sept. 29 reached [D1] [SS] $ 22.1 million [ES] , or [SS] 23 cents a share [ES] [D1]  , from [D1] [SS] $ 20.5 million [ES] , or [SS] 20 cents a share [ES] [D1]  , in the year-earlier quarter .
Bear Stearns is the holding company for Bear , Stearns & Co. , the investment [D1] [SS] banking [ES] and [SS] brokerage firm [ES] [D1]  .
Separately , PaineWebber posted net income for the third quarter of [D1] [SS] $ 16.8 million [ES] , or [SS] 41 cents a share [ES] [D1]  , reflecting a broad-based improvement in the company 's core businesses .
[D1] [SS] Retail profit surged [ES] , but [SS] the company said it was only a modest contributor to third-quarter results [ES] [D1]  .
A year ago , net at the New York investment banking firm was [D1] [SS] $ 20.9 million [ES] , or [SS] 50 cents a share [ES] [D1]  , including a special pretax gain of $ 46.3 million from the sale of the company 's interest in National Car Rental Systems Inc .
Purchase of the 76-story structure is subject to [D1] [SS] execution of a definitive agreement [ES] , [SS] approval by the boards of [D2] [SS] Seafirst [ES] and [SS] its parent company BankAmerica Corp. [ES] [D2]  [ES] , and [SS] approval by regulators [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] Individual investors [ES] , [SS] investment firms [ES] and [SS] arbitragers [ES] [D1]  who speculate in the stocks of takeover candidates can suffer [D1] [SS] liquidity [ES] and [SS] payment [ES] [D1]  problems when stocks dive ; those investors often [D1] [SS] borrow heavily to buy their holdings [ES] and [SS] use the stocks as collateral for loans [ES] [D1]  .
Added another executive at a big bank : [D1] [SS] We were all a little goosey over the weekend trying to forecast what would happen -LCB- Monday -RCB- [ES] , but [SS] it 's been very quiet [ES] [D1]  .
No fiddling with [D1] [SS] systems [ES] and [SS] procedures [ES] [D1]  will ever prevent markets from suffering a panic wave of selling .
But markets can operate with [D1] [SS] greater [ES] or [SS] lesser [ES] [D1]  efficiency .
The rationale is that an interruption of trading will allow investors to [D1] [SS] reconsider their strategies [ES] , [SS] calm sellers [ES] and [SS] lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels [ES] [D1]  .
But there is also the possibility that shutting down markets will [D1] [SS] intensify fears [ES] and [SS] cause an even more abrupt slide in prices [ES] [D1]  .
The futures exchanges [D1] [SS] followed their own pre-set circuit breakers [ES] and [SS] shut down at about 3 p.m. for 30 minutes , after the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock index had fallen [D2] [SS] 12 points [ES] , or [SS] about 100 points on the Dow Jones index [ES] [D2]  [ES] [D1]  .
Had the [D1] [SS] futures [ES] and [SS] options [ES] [D1]  markets been open , [D1] [SS] additional liquidity would have been provided [ES] and [SS] the decline , most probably , would have been less intense [ES] [D1]  .
At 3:30 , after intense telephone negotiations between [D1] [SS] the trading markets [ES] and [SS] Washington [ES] [D1]  , the futures exchanges reopened .
At this point , the options markets also [D1] [SS] shut down [ES] and [SS] once more left all sales to be handled by the New York Stock Exchange [ES] [D1]  .
It is time to recognize that [D1] [SS] the New York Stock Exchange [ES] , [SS] the futures markets [ES] and [SS] the options markets [ES] [D1]  , though physically separate , have actually become so closely intertwined as to constitute one market effectively .
Traders can [D1] [SS] vary their strategies [ES] and [SS] execute their orders in any one of them [ES] [D1]  .
To [D1] [SS] achieve maximum liquidity [ES] and [SS] minimize price volatility [ES] [D1]  , either [D1] [SS] all markets should be open to trading [ES] or [SS] none [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] Synchronized circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on Friday [ES] , but [SS] they probably would have made for smoother , less volatile executions [ES] [D1]  .
It 's time for [D1] [SS] the exchanges [ES] and [SS] the [D2] [SS] Securities [ES] and [SS] Exchange [ES] [D2]  Commission [ES] [D1]  to agree on joint conditions for [D1] [SS] halting trading [ES] or [SS] staying open [ES] [D1]  .
Let 's not have [D1] [SS] one market shut down for 30 minutes when the Dow declines 100 points [ES] and [SS] another shut down for an hour after a 250-point decline [ES] [D1]  .
The new circuit breakers , if they are to be applied at all , will require that [D1] [SS] futures [ES] and [SS] options [ES] [D1]  trading continue as long as the New York Stock Exchange remains open .
The rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting [D1] [SS] under the oversight [ES] and [SS] with the approval [ES] [D1]  of the government regulatory agencies .
Should [D1] [SS] the SEC [ES] and [SS] the Commodities Futures Trading Commission -LRB- which , with the SEC , regulates the Chicago stock-index markets -RRB- [ES] [D1]  be unable to agree , the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the Treasury secretary .
[D1] [SS] Telephone service has been improved for customers trying to reach their brokers [ES] , and [SS] specialists -- who I believe should stay , despite the urgings of some post-crash critics -- have larger capital positions [ES] [D1]  .
Witness the fact that trading in some stocks [D1] [SS] closed early Friday [ES] and [SS] opened late Monday [ES] [D1]  because of an excess of sell orders . -RRB-
A UNIFIED EUROPE poses labor [D1] [SS] problems [ES] and [SS] prospects [ES] [D1]  for U.S. firms .
[D1] [SS] FMC Corp. [ES] and [SS] Baxter International [ES] [D1]  say unions also wo n't like [D1] [SS] plant relocations [ES] and [SS] needed restructuring [ES] [D1]  , which means layoffs .
Many employers have already begun moving to southern countries such as [D1] [SS] Spain [ES] and [SS] Italy [ES] [D1]  , where [D1] [SS] wages are low [ES] and [SS] unions are weaker [ES] [D1]  ; demand for trained [D1] [SS] labor [ES] and [SS] managers [ES] [D1]  will rise there , FMC says .

The fan said [D1] [SS] he was [D2] [SS] punched [ES] and [SS] kicked [ES] [D2]  by one player [ES] and [SS] that the other broke his jaw with a baseball bat [ES] [D1]  .
The judge dismissed the fan 's suit against the team , however , ruling the Orioles [D1] [SS] innocent of negligent hiring [ES] , and [SS] not responsible for a fight that was outside the players ' employment [ES] [D1]  .
It also recommends [D1] [SS] better [D2] [SS] retirement [ES] and [SS] day-care [ES] [D2]  benefits [ES] , and [SS] basing pay on [D2] [SS] education [ES] , [SS] experience [ES] and [SS] nurses ' demanding work schedules [ES] [D2]  [ES] [D1]  .
Over a third of 618 hospitals surveyed by consultant Hewitt Associates use a clinical ladder , basing advancement on [D1] [SS] performance [ES] and [SS] education [ES] [D1]  .

TEMPORARY WORKERS have good educations , the National Association of Temporary Services says ; its survey of 2,508 such employees shows [D1] [SS] 82 % with more than a high-school education [ES] , and [SS] 31 % with college degrees [ES] [D1]  .

When [D1] [SS] it was all over [ES] and [SS] stocks had staged a huge recovery [ES] [D1]  , Big Board officials were self-congratulatory about how well the day had gone .
They said the exchange 's [D1] [SS] trading procedures [ES] , [SS] personnel [ES] , [SS] equipment [ES] and [SS] links with other exchanges [ES] [D1]  could n't have performed better .
The so-called circuit breakers devised by [D1] [SS] the Big Board [ES] and [SS] the Chicago Mercantile Exchange [ES] [D1]  to quell free falls in [D1] [SS] stock [ES] and [SS] futures [ES] [D1]  prices were n't triggered yesterday because the markets were higher for most of the day .
Chicken business is off largely because of more competition from [D1] [SS] grocery-store convenience food [ES] , [SS] home-delivered pizza [ES] and [SS] other takeout fare [ES] [D1]  , says a spokesman for the report , a publication of NPD Group , a market research firm in Port Washington , N.Y .
[D1] [SS] Church 's Fried Chicken Inc. [ES] and [SS] Popeye 's Famous Fried Chicken Inc. [ES] [D1]  , which have merged , are still troubled by overlapping restaurant locations .
Chicken chains also are feeling more pressure from McDonald 's Corp. , which [D1] [SS] introduced its McChicken sandwich this year [ES] and [SS] recently tested the sale of individual pieces of chicken [ES] [D1]  .
New management at Kentucky Fried Chicken , a unit of PepsiCo Inc. , has fought back with new [D1] [SS] medium [ES] and [SS] large [ES] [D1]  chicken sandwiches for the lunch crowd .
But some fast-food industry analysts say problems with keeping chicken [D1] [SS] warm [ES] and [SS] fresh [ES] [D1]  must be solved first .
He says the test is continuing in [D1] [SS] Chicago [ES] , [SS] Columbus , Ohio [ES] , and [SS] a few other cities [ES] [D1]  .
The advertising industry is buzzing with rumors that Kentucky Fried Chicken will [D1] [SS] drop Young & Rubicam [ES] and [SS] seek a new ad agency [ES] [D1]  .

[D1] [SS] Health [ES] and [SS] Human [ES] [D1]  Services Secretary Louis Sullivan has chosen Antonia Novello to be the next surgeon general , Bush administration officials said .
If she is [D1] [SS] nominated by President Bush [ES] and [SS] confirmed by the Senate [ES] [D1]  , Dr. Novello would succeed C. Everett Koop , who rattled [D1] [SS] liberals [ES] and [SS] conservatives [ES] [D1]  alike with his outspoken views on a range of health issues .
Dr. Novello , an expert on pediatric kidney diseases , is deputy director of the National Institute of [D1] [SS] Child Health [ES] and [SS] Human Development [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] Dr. Novello 's office said she would n't talk with reporters [ES] , and [SS] it refused to release any information about her [ES] [D1]  .
The newsletter Medicine & Health , which first disclosed her selection by Dr. Sullivan , said [D1] [SS] she is 44 years old [ES] and [SS] she studied at the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine [ES] [D1]  .
Kent Colton , NAHB executive vice president , argues that the U.S. faces a multifaceted housing crisis -- [D1] [SS] reduced affordability of homes for first-time buyers [ES] , [SS] increased homelessness [ES] , and [SS] lower apartment construction rates [ES] [D1]  -- that will be very difficult to solve without expanded federal resources .
It [D1] [SS] once pushed for a national housing production goal set by the federal government [ES] and [SS] has regularly advanced anti-recession housing measures [ES] [D1]  .
The association is pushing an [D1] [SS] extensive [ES] and [SS] expensive [ES] [D1]  wish-list , which would substantially boost spending above the current level of more than $ 15 billion annually .
It would like to [D1] [SS] peg the ceiling on Federal Housing Administration mortgage guarantees to 95 % of the median price in a particular market , instead of limiting it to $ 101,250 [ES] ; [SS] [D2] [SS] reduce -LRB- or even eliminate -RRB- FHA down-payment requirements [ES] and [SS] increase the availability of variable-rate mortgages [ES] [D2]  [ES] ; [SS] expand the Veterans Affairs Department loan guarantee program [ES] ; [SS] provide adequate funding for the Farmers Home Administration -LRB- FmHA -RRB- [ES] ; [SS] increase [D2] [SS] federal funding [ES] and [SS] tax incentives [ES] [D2]  for the construction of [D2] [SS] low-income [ES] and [SS] rental [ES] [D2]  housing , including $ 4 billion in block grants to [D2] [SS] states [ES] and [SS] localities [ES] [D2]  [ES] ; and [SS] fully fund the McKinney Act , a $ 656 million potpourri for the homeless [ES] [D1]  .
Direct federal subsidies for housing construction [D1] [SS] have proved intolerably expensive in the past [ES] , and [SS] inevitably are twisted to the benefit of [D2] [SS] well-connected [D3] [SS] developers [ES] and [SS] lobbyists [ES] [D3]  , as demonstrated by the ongoing HUD scandal , [ES] or [SS] congressmen [ES] [D2]  [ES] [D1]  .
Though Mr. Colton says expanding FHA lending would result in no cost to the government , the mere diversion of funds [D1] [SS] from other parts of the economy [ES] and [SS] from other forms of housing -LRB- such as low-income -RRB- [ES] [D1]  to the single-family home market would result in a major expense .
More important , housing programs run by [D1] [SS] HUD [ES] , [SS] the VA [ES] , and [SS] FmHA [ES] [D1]  are awash in red ink .
[D1] [SS] The federal government has had to pump in $ 2.28 billion into the VA housing program since 1984 to keep the fund afloat [ES] and [SS] the VA requested an additional $ 120 million for the fiscal year just ended [ES] [D1]  .
It points to the pernicious impact of local government regulation , particularly [D1] [SS] zoning [ES] and [SS] building [ES] [D1]  fees , which pushes the price of housing out of the reach of [D1] [SS] low- [ES] and [SS] middle-income [ES] [D1]  people .
But while the NAHB has suggested actions that [D1] [SS] states [ES] and [SS] localities [ES] [D1]  should take to reduce regulatory barriers , the association has proposed no activist legislative program -- comparable to , say , its detailed request for more federal subsidies -- to eliminate counterproductive controls .
[D1] [SS] The builders like the subsidies [ES] , but [SS] at the same time they tend to be fiscal conservatives in terms of major issues , such as the balanced-budget amendment [ES] [D1]  .
The real key is to have [D1] [SS] the economy working [ES] and [SS] interest rates down [ES] [D1]  .
More money for HUD will [D1] [SS] increase the deficit [ES] and [SS] destabilize the economy [ES] [D1]  ; more money to municipalities that are wrecking their local housing markets will further insulate them from the destructive effects of their policies .
According to diplomatic sources in Brussels , most EC leaders agree that talks [D1] [SS] should begin in the second half of 1990 [ES] , and [SS] will make a declaration on that during a summit meeting in Strasbourg , France , on Dec. [D2] [SS] 8 [ES] and [SS] 9 [ES] [D2]  [ES] [D1]  .
Setting a date to start treaty negotiations [D1] [SS] has no legal significance in itself [ES] , but [SS] could be viewed as an important psychological push [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] French President Francois Mitterrand fought to set a date for the conference during the EC summit in Madrid last June [ES] , but [SS] the move was scuttled because of opposition by [D2] [SS] Mrs. Thatcher [ES] and [SS] West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl [ES] [D2]  [ES] [D1]  .
Although the union-bidder expects to patch together a substitute offer , consisting of less cash , the failure to get cash from [D1] [SS] Japanese [ES] and [SS] American [ES] [D1]  banks confirmed a growing fear among arbitragers that the pageant of high-leverage takeover deals is ending .
Lots of other entries made up the parade , of course -- notably [D1] [SS] a surprisingly large increase in producer prices , signalling Federal Reserve tightness [ES] ; and [SS] the Bush administration 's -LRB- temporary ? -RRB- defeat in trying to lower the capital-gains tax [ES] [D1]  .
The multibillion-dollar prospects , where the bidder must [D1] [SS] line up a consortium of banks [ES] and\/or [SS] issue billions in high-yield debt [ES] [D1]  , were where the damage was concentrated .
The growing financial difficulties of recent high-leverage [D1] [SS] restructurings [ES] or [SS] takeovers [ES] [D1]  , such as [D1] [SS] Resorts International [ES] , [SS] Integrated Resources [ES] , and [SS] Campeau 's retailing empire [ES] [D1]  , have cast a pall over the entire market for high-yield securities .
Investors have reacted [D1] [SS] by ignoring recent efforts to float junk bonds by Ohio Mattress [ES] and [SS] by forcing Ramada to postpone indefinitely its planned junk-bond [D2] [SS] sale [ES] and [SS] restructuring [ES] [D2]  [ES] [D1]  .
As a result , [D1] [SS] high-yield mutual funds have declined across the board [ES] and [SS] the many firms planning to sell $ 11 billion in junk bonds before year-end are experiencing anxious times [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] These are all market excesses -LRB- putting aside the artificial boosts that the tax code gives to debt over equity -RRB- [ES] , and [SS] what we 've seen is the market reining them in [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] Of course , [D2] [SS] Washington had n't been silent in the days leading up to the debacle [ES] , and [SS] its tendency to meddle in the leverage equation remains a troublesome prospect [ES] [D2]  [ES] , but [SS] those preliminary steps should n't distract us from the basic market fundamentalism that was at work on Friday [ES] [D1]  .
If it is correct to find that concerns over [D1] [SS] corporate debt [ES] and [SS] LBOs [ES] [D1]  caused Gray Friday , what are the implications for policy makers ?
To the extent that Friday 's sell-off reflected a sudden reappraisal of the excesses of leverage , the message is that [D1] [SS] Wall Street [ES] and [SS] the private markets [ES] [D1]  are fully capable of imposing the appropriate [D1] [SS] incentives [ES] and [SS] sanctions [ES] [D1]  on corporate behavior .
The national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of [D1] [SS] bankers [ES] and [SS] investors [ES] [D1]  be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of [D1] [SS] various LBO deals [ES] and [SS] leveraged restructurings [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] The recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets [ES] and [SS] the scarcity of bank capital for recent deals [ES] [D1]  underscores the wisdom of letting the free markets operate .
If takeover premiums become excessive , if LBO dealmakers become too aggressive , then [D1] [SS] the private market will recognize these problems more [D2] [SS] quickly [ES] and [SS] accurately [ES] [D2]  than will policy makers [ES] , and [SS] the markets will move with lightning speed to impose appropriate sanctions [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] Yes , the broader exchanges got caught up in the spiral [ES] , but [SS] they rode the tiger up all year [ES] [D1]  .
The [D1] [SS] arbitragers [ES] and [SS] takeover initiatiors [ES] [D1]  got killed on Gray Friday , while the besieged managers of prospective targets cheered lustily .
If you identify with the besieged managers , you must concede that [D1] [SS] speedy [ES] and [SS] effective [ES] [D1]  relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from Washington .
If you side with the [D1] [SS] arbitragers [ES] and [SS] raiders [ES] [D1]  , you clearly have more to fear from private investors than from regulators , although the Delaware courts should never be underestimated .
Any such attempt [D1] [SS] to distinguish good debt from bad debt [ES] , or [SS] to draw the line at a particular industry , such as the airlines , [ES] [D1]  is likely to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to [D1] [SS] equity markets [ES] and [SS] economic efficiency in general [ES] [D1]  .
Far better for policy makers to concentrate on [D1] [SS] the war against drugs [ES] , [SS] Panama [ES] and [SS] the deficit [ES] [D1]  , all of them parades that seem never to end .

The index slid [D1] [SS] 647.33 points [ES] , or [SS] 1.8 % [ES] [D1]  , on Monday .
Shares also closed sharply lower across Europe , particularly in Frankfurt , although [D1] [SS] London [ES] and [SS] a few other markets [ES] [D1]  recovered some ground after stocks began to rebound in New York .
[D1] [SS] Other [D2] [SS] Asian [ES] and [SS] Pacific [ES] [D2]  markets had sharper losses than Tokyo [ES] , but [SS] the selling wave stopped short of precipitating another market crash [ES] [D1]  .
Still , despite the sudden reappearance of stock-market turbulence , managers of Japanese investment funds said they were n't planning to unload [D1] [SS] U.S. [ES] or [SS] European [ES] [D1]  equities .
We did n't trade much today , as our policy now is to [D1] [SS] wait [ES] and [SS] see [ES] [D1]  , said a fund manager at Taisho Life Insurance Co .
We would like to [D1] [SS] wait [ES] and [SS] see [ES] [D1]  until trading goes around through [D1] [SS] Europe [ES] and [SS] New York [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] The institutions appeared confident that Japanese regulators would step in to ensure orderly trading if necessary [ES] , and [SS] there was considerable speculation during the day that the Finance Ministry was working behind the scenes to do just that [ES] [D1]  .
At the close , the Nikkei average of 225 stocks stood at 34468.69 , down [D1] [SS] 647.33 points [ES] , or [SS] 1.8 % [ES] [D1]  .
The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index sank [D1] [SS] 45.66 [ES] , or [SS] 1.7 % [ES] [D1]  , to 2600.88 .
[D1] [SS] A midmorning rebound brought it back to show a gain of about 200 at the end of the morning session [ES] , but [SS] [D2] [SS] the rally failed in the afternoon [ES] , and [SS] the market closed near the day 's low [ES] [D2]  [ES] [D1]  .
The Tokyo Stock Exchange index for the second section fell [D1] [SS] 100.96 [ES] , or [SS] 2.7 % [ES] [D1]  , to 3655.40 .
Japanese [D1] [SS] investors [ES] and [SS] traders [ES] [D1]  expressed relief that the Tokyo market did n't fall more sharply .
[D1] [SS] On Oct. 16 , 1987 -- the Friday before the Black Monday crash -- the New York market dropped 4.6 % [ES] , and [SS] Tokyo followed on Monday with a 2.4 % drop [ES] [D1]  .
He described Friday 's plunge in the U.S. as a fleeting event resulting in part from excessive [D1] [SS] merger [ES] and [SS] acquisition [ES] [D1]  activity .
[D1] [SS] Those shares which had posted gains on M&A speculation were dashed with cold water [ES] , but [SS] as far as major stocks are concerned , there is n't much impact [ES] [D1]  .
Among other [D1] [SS] Asian [ES] and [SS] Pacific [ES] [D1]  markets , [D1] [SS] Malaysia [ES] and [SS] Singapore [ES] [D1]  had the biggest losses , with [D1] [SS] the Kuala Lumpur composite index in Malaysia falling 11.5 % [ES] and [SS] Singapore 's Straits Times Industrial Index down 10 % [ES] [D1]  .
Major indexes declined [D1] [SS] more than 8 % in [D2] [SS] Australia [ES] and [SS] New Zealand [ES] [D2]  [ES] and [SS] 6.5 % in Hong Kong [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] Bangkok [ES] , [SS] Manila [ES] , [SS] Seoul [ES] , [SS] Taipei [ES] and [SS] Jakarta [ES] [D1]  escaped with slightly smaller losses .
[D1] [SS] Brokers [ES] and [SS] fund managers [ES] [D1]  said the region 's markets were reacting to Friday 's Wall Street plunge even though that decline was due to local factors such as [D1] [SS] failed corporate buy-outs [ES] and [SS] a deteriorating junk-bond market [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] [D2] [SS] Markets in this region are n't so geared to leveraged buy-outs [ES] , and [SS] their economies generally are in good shape [ES] [D2]  [ES] , but [SS] there 's no doubt that Asia is still following America 's lead [ES] [D1]  .
Several analysts said [D1] [SS] Malaysia [ES] and [SS] Singapore [ES] [D1]  had the biggest losses because they are relatively open to rapid cash flows .
[D1] [SS] Hong Kong is the region 's next most open market [ES] , but [SS] many foreign investors have been staying away from it since it plunged in June amid political turmoil in China [ES] [D1]  .
Richard Chenevix-Trench , a director at Hong Kong-based Baring International Fund Managers Ltd. , said the market probably [D1] [SS] has n't hit bottom yet [ES] but [SS] is close [ES] [D1]  .
Nestor Hinzack , an analyst at brokerage firm Burdett , Buckeridge & Young Ltd. , described the market 's performance as sheep-like as investors [D1] [SS] fled to bluechip Australian stocks [ES] and [SS] shunned entrepreneurial companies they perceived as having any takeover premium built into the price [ES] [D1]  .
London 's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index , the most closely watched market barometer , ended at its intraday high of 2163.4 , down [D1] [SS] 70.5 [ES] , or [SS] 3.2 % [ES] [D1]  .
The decline in the German Stock Index of [D1] [SS] 203.56 points [ES] , or [SS] 12.8 % [ES] [D1]  , to 1385.72 was the Frankfurt market 's steepest fall ever .
Analysts cited memories of two years ago , when [D1] [SS] many small investors held on to their shares after the October crash [ES] but [SS] the West German market continued to decline steeply for the next three months [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] We 've always thought that Mr. Wright underestimated California 's vitality [ES] , but [SS] maybe the state 's la-la factions are starting to overwhelm the forces that made it such a significant place [ES] [D1]  .
What else is one to make of the whacky save-the-earth initiative [D1] [SS] just proposed by several major environmental groups [ES] and [SS] organized by the state 's attorney general [ES] [D1]  ?
If passed by the voters , the recently announced initiative would [D1] [SS] phase out major pesticides [ES] , [SS] reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40 % [ES] , [SS] ban new offshore drilling [ES] , [SS] ban chemicals thought to deplete the ozone layer [ES] , and [SS] create a new state environmental officer armed with a $ 40 million budget to sue any [D2] [SS] firm [ES] or [SS] agency [ES] [D2]  he thinks is being too dirty [ES] [D1]  .
The initiative is based largely on the wish-lists of the green lobby : [D1] [SS] the Sierra Club [ES] , [SS] the League of Conservation Voters [ES] , [SS] the Natural Resources Defense Council [ES] , [SS] the National Toxics Campaign [ES] and [SS] the Citizens for a Better Environment [ES] [D1]  .
Not only [D1] [SS] Californians [ES] but [SS] all Americans [ES] [D1]  would pay if this thing passed .
[D1] [SS] Kansas wheat farmers [ES] and [SS] Florida fruit growers [ES] [D1]  would have to [D1] [SS] adjust [ES] or [SS] give up the California market [ES] [D1]  .
But if [D1] [SS] rational science [ES] and [SS] economics [ES] [D1]  have nothing to do with the new environment initiative , what is going on ?
Mr. Van de Kamp is the one who [D1] [SS] collected the plans from the various radical environmental groups [ES] and [SS] cobbled them into a single unwieldy initiative to be placed on the ballot for election on Nov. 6 , 1990 [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] This initiative is being labeled The Big Green [ES] , but [SS] maybe it should be called The Big Greenback [ES] [D1]  .
The initiative creates a free floating state environmental officer to sue [D1] [SS] companies [ES] or [SS] government agencies [ES] [D1]  that do things he does n't like .
That means [D1] [SS] the NRDC [ES] and [SS] such groups [ES] [D1]  no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation ; taxpayers would bear the cost .
[D1] [SS] Mr. Van de Kamp [ES] and [SS] his allies [ES] [D1]  may be hoping that the environment is such a [D1] [SS] mom [ES] and [SS] apple-pie [ES] [D1]  issue among certain segments of California 's population now that almost any collection of anti-scientific , anti-pocketbook nonsense can pass under its rubric .
And some other segments of California 's [D1] [SS] political [ES] and [SS] media [ES] [D1]  culture may yet start to point out that the initiative would impose significant costs on the state 's less affluent citizens in the form of [D1] [SS] higher food prices [ES] and [SS] lost jobs [ES] [D1]  .
This grandiose initiative will help California define itself for the future either [D1] [SS] as a state still tethered to [D2] [SS] economic [ES] and [SS] scientific [ES] [D2]  reality [ES] , or [SS] as one being led to wherever its la-la activists want to take it [ES] [D1]  .
Spurred by waves of large-scale buying in blue-chip stocks , the Dow Jones Industrial Average [D1] [SS] rallied yesterday [ES] and [SS] erased about a half of Friday 's 190.58-point plunge , gaining 88.12 to 2657.38 [ES] [D1]  .
While the advance cheered investors who feared a 1987-style crash would occur yesterday , it was strictly a big-stock rally fed by huge buying by [D1] [SS] bargain-hunting institutions [ES] and [SS] program traders [ES] [D1]  .
A troubling sign : [D1] [SS] Declining stocks on the Big Board outnumbered advancers , 975 to 749 [ES] , and [SS] the over-the-counter market that includes many smaller stocks suffered aftershocks of Friday 's late Big Board plunge [ES] [D1]  .
Transports plunged on takeover disappointments in two airline stocks , [D1] [SS] UAL [ES] and [SS] AMR [ES] [D1]  , which each fell more than 20 % when they reopened for trading yesterday after being suspended Friday afternoon .
Overall , [D1] [SS] this is a pleasant rally [ES] but [SS] it 's very selective [ES] [D1]  , said Arthur Cashin Jr. , a veteran PaineWebber Inc. trader at the Big Board .
Everyone was a little concerned about the [D1] [SS] general narrowness of the rally [ES] and [SS] failure of the OTC market to get into plus territory [ES] [D1]  .
The rally gave credence , at least for now , to the pre-trading declaration of Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. that Friday 's market debacle was [D1] [SS] an abnormal condition [ES] , and not [SS] a disaster [ES] [D1]  .
But most of the 30 blue-chip stocks in the average , including [D1] [SS] Eastman Kodak [ES] and [SS] General Motors [ES] [D1]  , could n't trade because of the heavy backlog of sell orders left over from Friday 's late-afternoon rout .
[D1] [SS] The Dow dropped to a quick 27-point loss [ES] , and [SS] to many traders it looked as if stocks were headed for yet another big tumble [ES] [D1]  .
There was heavy stock-index arbitrage , as traders [D1] [SS] sold big baskets of stock [ES] and [SS] bought stock-index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets [ES] [D1]  .
With program traders seemingly in charge , buyers [D1] [SS] backed away from the market [ES] and [SS] watched stocks fall [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] Then at 10:15 the Dow suddenly started to rebound [ES] , and [SS] when it shot upward it did so even faster than the early-morning fall [ES] [D1]  .
All the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that [D1] [SS] big investment banks [ES] and [SS] major money management firms [ES] [D1]  started buying stocks heavily .
With the market down like this , we 'll probably [D1] [SS] take another $ 50 million [ES] and [SS] put it in the market [ES] [D1]  .
But then it shot upward 7 1\/2 as Goldman , Sachs & Co. [D1] [SS] stepped in [ES] and [SS] bought [ES] [D1]  , traders said .
There was n't a lot of panic selling , either [D1] [SS] domestically [ES] or [SS] internationally [ES] [D1]  ... .
Still , [D1] [SS] the market had n't yet crossed into positive territory [ES] , and [SS] traders were glum [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] But in another dramatic burst , the Dow tacked on 42 points in five minutes [ES] , and [SS] at 10:25 the index showed a gain of 5.74 [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] On the Big Board floor [ES] and [SS] on trading desks [ES] [D1]  , traders yelped their approval .
[D1] [SS] Many market makers in the S&P 100 index options contract had bullish positions Friday [ES] , and [SS] when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses [ES] [D1]  .
James Gallagher , a partner at specialist Fowler & Rosenau , said , The difference between [D1] [SS] today [ES] and [SS] two years ago -- Terrible Tuesday , Oct. 20 , 1987 -- [ES] [D1]  is that then we needed a savior to [D1] [SS] go into the Major Market Index [ES] , [SS] spend $ 2 million [ES] and [SS] get the program rally started [ES] [D1]  .
This time -LCB- institutions -RCB- [D1] [SS] saw the programs coming [ES] and [SS] backed away [ES] and [SS] backed away [ES] [D1]  .
Although the Big Board 's specialist firms struggled through another highly volatile trading session , their performance yesterday was better than during Friday 's late-afternoon chaos , according to [D1] [SS] traders [ES] and [SS] brokers [ES] [D1]  who work with them .
But yesterday , even with halts in such major blue-chip stocks as Merck , [D1] [SS] we expected -LRB- the halts -RRB- [ES] and [SS] it was n't too bad [ES] [D1]  , said Donaldson 's Mr. Eppel , who had been critical of the specialists ' performance on Friday .
According to a Big Board official , while many stocks opened late , there were subsequent trading halts in only three issues -- [D1] [SS] AMR [ES] , [SS] Merck [ES] and [SS] Valero Energy [ES] [D1]  .
Yet from the Dow industrials ' high on Oct. 9 through Friday 's plunge , relatively good performances have been turned in by [D1] [SS] real-estate [ES] , [SS] utilities [ES] , [SS] precious metals [ES] and [SS] life insurance stocks [ES] [D1]  .
For example , [D1] [SS] Halliburton jumped 3 1\/4 to 38 [ES] , [SS] Schlumberger rose 2 1\/2 to 43 1\/4 [ES] and [SS] Baker Hughes rose 1 1\/8 to 22 [ES] [D1]  .
Because of the [D1] [SS] UAL [ES] and [SS] AMR [ES] [D1]  tumbles , airlines were the weakest sector of the market yesterday .
Among other major issues , [D1] [SS] Coca-Cola Co. closed up 2 at 66 3\/4 on 1.7 million shares [ES] and [SS] American Telephone & Telegraph rose 3 1\/4 to 43 on nearly 7.8 million shares [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] Merrill Lynch added 1 3\/4 to 28 [ES] , [SS] PaineWebber rose 3\/4 to 18 1\/2 [ES] and [SS] Bear Stearns rose 3\/8 to 14 1\/4 [ES] [D1]  .
At a news conference after the close of trading yesterday , [D1] [SS] the Big Board 's Mr. Phelan [ES] and [SS] other exchange officials [ES] [D1]  praised the performance of their [D1] [SS] computers [ES] and [SS] personnel [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] Program trades make up 10 % of the exchange 's volume on an average day [ES] , but [SS] despite the increase Friday , it was certainly not something you would say precipitated the market decline , Mr. Phelan said [ES] [D1]  .
He said [D1] [SS] that exchange officials had conversations with Wall Street firms throughout the weekend [ES] and [SS] that all the participants behaved very , very responsibly today [ES] [D1]  .
Instead , they [D1] [SS] bought on weakness [ES] and [SS] sold into the strength [ES] [D1]  , which kept the market orderly .
Mr. Phelan said the performance of specialists during Friday 's plunge was admirable , because out of 1,640 Big Board common stocks traded during the day only seven [D1] [SS] were closed [ES] and [SS] were n't reopened before the close [ES] [D1]  .

West Germany 's Green Party joined its ideological soulmates [D1] [SS] Jeremy Rifkin [ES] and [SS] the Christic Institute [ES] [D1]  in the legal battle to ground [D1] [SS] the Atlantis shuttle [ES] and [SS] its plutonium-powered Galileo probe to Jupiter [ES] [D1]  .

A House-Senate conference approved a permanent smoking ban [D1] [SS] on all domestic airline routes within the continental U.S. [ES] and [SS] on all flights of six hours or less to [D2] [SS] Alaska [ES] and [SS] Hawaii [ES] [D2]  [ES] [D1]  .
The restrictions would [D1] [SS] cover all but a small percentage of domestic air traffic [ES] , and [SS] represent a major expansion of the current smoking ban on flights of two hours or less [ES] [D1]  .
The exemption allowed on longer flights to [D1] [SS] Alaska [ES] and [SS] Hawaii [ES] [D1]  appears to be largely a face-saving concession for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry , which has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in recent years .
[D1] [SS] As a practical matter , flights from the West Coast to Hawaii would be covered as they are under the time limit [ES] , but [SS] the language would exempt longer routes beginning , for example , [D2] [SS] in Chicago [ES] or [SS] on the East Coast [ES] [D2]  [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] The measure is attached to the more than $ 26 billion fiscal 1990 transportation bill within Mr. Lautenberg 's jurisdiction [ES] , and [SS] the final compromise is laced with more than $ 205 million in road projects earmarked by members as well as funds sought by major airports , including Denver [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] Majority Whip William Gray owes a political debt to Southern agriculture lawmakers for his rise in the House [ES] , and [SS] the Philadelphia Democrat used his position in the conference to salvage the exemption from a total ban [ES] [D1]  .
Although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest , the underlying bill was the subject of behind-the-scenes lobbying because of its impact on [D1] [SS] air transportation [ES] and [SS] the [D2] [SS] more mundane [ES] , but [SS] politically important [ES] [D2]  , projects of members [ES] [D1]  .
In a stark lesson in the power of the appropriations committees , the House deliberately killed a handful of projects backed by lawmakers in [D1] [SS] Florida [ES] , [SS] Illinois [ES] and [SS] Pennsylvania [ES] [D1]  who had voted against the panel leadership on the House floor .
Within the Federal Aviation Administration , [D1] [SS] the final bill promises to increase spending for [D2] [SS] facilities [ES] and [SS] equipment [ES] [D2]  by more than 20 % from last year [ES] , and [SS] total operations would rise to $ 3.84 billion -- a 12 % boost [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] The facilities account includes $ 40 million for Denver 's ambitious new airport [ES] , and [SS] the competition for these funds created shifting alliances between urban lawmakers representing [D2] [SS] established airports in [D3] [SS] Philadelphia [ES] and [SS] Michigan [ES] [D3]  [ES] and [SS] the major carriers to Denver , [D3] [SS] United [ES] and [SS] Continental [ES] [D3]  [ES] [D2]  [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] Texas Air Corp. , which owns Continental , [ES] and [SS] the Air Transport Association [ES] [D1]  were prominent in the lobbying .
The industry sought to impose conditions that would have delayed funds for the project until [D1] [SS] Denver [ES] and [SS] the airlines [ES] [D1]  had agreed to leases for 50 % of the gates .
Though smaller in total dollars , the conference agreed to preserve an estimated $ 30.6 million in controversial subsidies to carriers serving [D1] [SS] rural [ES] or [SS] isolated [ES] [D1]  airports .
[D1] [SS] The sum is more than double what the House had approved for the program [ES] , but [SS] the list of qualified airports would be cut by 22 under [D2] [SS] new distance requirements [ES] and [SS] limits on the level of subsidy [ES] [D2]  [ES] [D1]  .
Among [D1] [SS] rail [ES] and [SS] highway [ES] [D1]  accounts , the agreement provides $ 615 million for Amtrak , including $ 85 million for capital improvements .

On Seventh Avenue , designers have been advancing the monochrome look with clothing collections done entirely in [D1] [SS] black [ES] and [SS] white [ES] [D1]  .
The pendulum is swinging back to [D1] [SS] black [ES] and [SS] white [ES] [D1]  , says Richard DeMoulin , the general manager of Eastman Kodak Co. 's professional photography division .
[D1] [SS] But last year , buoyed by increased use in [D2] [SS] advertising [ES] and [SS] other commercial applications [ES] [D2]  , sales increased 5 % [ES] , and [SS] they are expected to jump at least that much again this year [ES] [D1]  .
Photographic companies are scrambling to tap the resurging market , [D1] [SS] reviving some black-and-white product lines [ES] and [SS] developing new ones [ES] [D1]  .
At Kodak , which largely ignored the market for years , black-and-white film sales now account for nearly 15 % of the company 's $ 3 billion in [D1] [SS] film [ES] and [SS] paper [ES] [D1]  sales annually , up from 10 % three years ago .

You can shift out of reality with [D1] [SS] black [ES] and [SS] white [ES] [D1]  , he adds .
Such features have been especially attractive to [D1] [SS] professional photographers [ES] and [SS] marketing executives [ES] [D1]  , who have been steadily increasing their use of [D1] [SS] black [ES] and [SS] white [ES] [D1]  in advertising .
Consider Gap Inc. , whose latest ad campaign features black-and-white shots of [D1] [SS] Hollywood stars [ES] , [SS] artists [ES] and [SS] other well-known personalities [ES] [D1]  modeling the retailer 's [D1] [SS] jeans [ES] and [SS] T-shirts [ES] [D1]  .

[D1] [SS] We wanted to highlight the individual , not the environment , [ES] he says , and [SS] [D2] [SS] black [ES] and [SS] white [ES] [D2]  allows you to do that better than color [ES] [D1]  .
Even [D1] [SS] food products [ES] and [SS] automobiles [ES] [D1]  , which have long depended on color , are making the switch .
Companies feel [D1] [SS] black [ES] and [SS] white [ES] [D1]  will convey a stronger statement , says Marc L. Hauser , a Chicago photographer who is working on a black-and-white print ad for Stouffer Food Corp. 's Lean Cuisine .

Typically , it [D1] [SS] must be mailed to a handful of processors [ES] and [SS] may take a week or more to be [D2] [SS] processed [ES] and [SS] returned [ES] [D2]  [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] Black-and-white film costs consumers a little less than color film [ES] , and [SS] processing costs the same [ES] [D1]  .
Similarly , Agfa is sponsoring scores of photography contests at [D1] [SS] high schools [ES] and [SS] colleges [ES] [D1]  , offering free [D1] [SS] black-and-white film [ES] and [SS] paper [ES] [D1]  as prizes .

But some industry observers believe the resurgence of [D1] [SS] black [ES] and [SS] white [ES] [D1]  is only a fad .
They cite [D1] [SS] the emergence of still electronic photography [ES] , [SS] more newspapers turning to color on their pages [ES] and [SS] measurable improvements in the quality of color prints [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] Black [ES] and [SS] white [ES] [D1]  has n't made the same quantum leaps in technological development as color , says Mr. Butler of the Rochester Institute .

The Sacramento , Calif. , company also attributed improved performance to [D1] [SS] a lower effective tax rate [ES] and [SS] higher interest income [ES] [D1]  .
For the nine months , the newspaper chain had almost a 23 % increase in profit to [D1] [SS] $ 23.6 million [ES] , or [SS] 83 cents a share [ES] [D1]  , from [D1] [SS] $ 19.2 million [ES] , or [SS] 68 cents a share [ES] [D1]  .

[D1] [SS] Those two offers were private [ES] and [SS] the spokesman refused to identify the bidding companies [ES] [D1]  .
While Friday 's plunging stock market prompted new fears about the economy 's prospects , a little-known indicator that has faithfully foreshadowed the economy 's [D1] [SS] ups [ES] and [SS] downs [ES] [D1]  by exceptionally long lead times points to a sustained rise in overall business activity .
[D1] [SS] The barometer , developed by analysts at Columbia University 's Center for International Business Cycle Research here , reached a record high of 223.0 in August , the latest month available , [ES] and [SS] the Columbia researchers estimate that it has moved even higher since then [ES] [D1]  .
The latest reading of 223.0 was up [D1] [SS] from 222.3 in July [ES] and [SS] 215.3 as recently as March [ES] [D1]  .
A leading authority on the business cycle , Mr. Moore also is a member of the Business Cycle Dating Group , the panel of private economists that decides for the government when [D1] [SS] expansions [ES] and [SS] recessions [ES] [D1]  [D1] [SS] begin [ES] and [SS] end [ES] [D1]  .
Based largely on the recent strength in their index , called the long leading indicator , the Columbia analysts foresee uninterrupted economic growth through [D1] [SS] the rest of this year [ES] and [SS] next year as well [ES] [D1]  .
Underlying this optimism is the index 's longstanding ability to signal [D1] [SS] recessions [ES] or [SS] recoveries [ES] [D1]  , as the case may be , by substantially greater periods than the Commerce Department 's index of leading indicators .
Over the full post-World War II era , the Columbia index , on the average , has [D1] [SS] entered sustained declines 14 months before the onset of recessions [ES] and [SS] turned up eight months before recoveries [ES] [D1]  .
The comparable lead times for the Commerce index , whose components include the stock market , are far shorter -- [D1] [SS] 10 months before recessions [ES] and [SS] only three months before recoveries [ES] [D1]  .
The indicator [D1] [SS] reached a peak in January 1929 [ES] and [SS] then fell steadily [D2] [SS] up to [ES] and [SS] through [ES] [D2]  the crash [ES] [D1]  .
Other components of the long leading indicator include [D1] [SS] a ratio of prices to unit labor costs in manufacturing industries [ES] , [SS] the M2 version of the money supply , adjusted for inflation [ES] , and [SS] the volume of new home-building permits [ES] [D1]  .
Notably absent from the Columbia index is the stock market , which Mr. Moore says is simply no longer such a good indicator of the economy 's long-range prospects , though it still is useful for anticipating some short-run [D1] [SS] twists [ES] and [SS] turns [ES] [D1]  .
Stocks have become more sensitive to factors not directly tied to the domestic economy , Mr. Moore says , citing [D1] [SS] the exchange rate for the dollar on currency markets [ES] , [SS] the foreign-trade balance [ES] and [SS] inflows of foreign capital [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] The French group has an agreement giving it the right to buy all the shares outstanding [ES] , and [SS] this could be completed within a few months [ES] [D1]  , a BSN spokeswoman said .

There 's a good chance that gold will [D1] [SS] retain its gains [ES] and [SS] rise further [ES] [D1]  , he said .
This would be [D1] [SS] damaging to the dollar [ES] and [SS] supportive for gold [ES] [D1]  , he said .

The prices of [D1] [SS] cattle [ES] and [SS] hog [ES] [D1]  futures contracts dropped sharply because traders speculated that the stock market plunge Friday will linger in the minds of U.S. consumers long enough to prompt them to rein in their spending at the supermarket , which would hurt demand for [D1] [SS] beef [ES] and [SS] pork [ES] [D1]  .

[D1] [SS] The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped sharply yesterday to close at 2657.38 [ES] , [SS] panic did n't sweep the world 's markets [ES] , and [SS] investors [D2] [SS] large [ES] and [SS] small [ES] [D2]  seemed to accept Friday 's dizzying 190-point plunge as a sharp correction , not a calamity [ES] [D1]  .

Shortly after completing the $ 1.56 billion acquisition of West Point-Pepperell Inc. in April , Mr. Farley 's holding company , Farley Inc. , said it was considering the sale of Cluett , [D1] [SS] a leading shirt maker [ES] and [SS] one of West Point-Pepperell 's biggest units [ES] [D1]  .
Included in the sale are Cluett units that [D1] [SS] make men 's shirts under the Arrow name [ES] , [SS] socks under the Gold Toe name [ES] and [SS] menswear through the Schoeneman division [ES] [D1]  .
The companies said the agreement is subject [D1] [SS] to Bidermann 's receipt of financing [ES] and [SS] to [D2] [SS] regulatory [ES] and [SS] other [ES] [D2]  approvals [ES] [D1]  .
Mr. Farley followed a similar pattern when he [D1] [SS] acquired Northwest Industries Inc. [ES] and [SS] then sold much of its assets [ES] [D1]  .
But he kept Fruit of the Loom Inc. , the underwear maker that he still [D1] [SS] controls [ES] and [SS] serves as [D2] [SS] chairman [ES] and [SS] chief executive [ES] [D2]  [ES] [D1]  .
Cluett was an independent company until West Point-Pepperell acquired it for $ 375 million in [D1] [SS] cash [ES] and [SS] stock [ES] [D1]  in 1986 .

Britain 's Blue Arrow PLC intends to [D1] [SS] change its name to Manpower PLC [ES] and [SS] write off a chunk of the nearly $ 1.2 billion in good will realized in the takeover of U.S.-based Manpower Inc [ES] [D1]  .
The [D1] [SS] name change [ES] and [SS] good will [ES] [D1]  write-off could help [D1] [SS] solidify Blue Arrow 's dominance of the U.S. temporary-help market [ES] and [SS] give it a more American image [ES] [D1]  as U.S. investors turn jittery about foreign stocks after Friday 's market plunge .
Blue Arrow was able to pull off the $ 1.34 billion takeover of Manpower in 1987 largely because different [D1] [SS] British [ES] and [SS] American [ES] [D1]  accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for British companies .
Good will is the excess of cost of an [D1] [SS] acquired firm [ES] , [SS] operating unit [ES] or [SS] assets [ES] [D1]  over the [D1] [SS] current [ES] or [SS] fair [ES] [D1]  market value of those assets .
But with so many shares now held in the U.S. , Blue Arrow reports its earnings two ways , based on both [D1] [SS] U.K. [ES] and [SS] U.S. [ES] [D1]  accounting standards .
Mr. Fromstein [D1] [SS] said he hopes to eradicate some of the good will left on Blue Arrow 's U.S. books in one fell swoop [ES] , but [SS] would n't specify how much [ES] [D1]  .
Barry Wright , acquired by Applied for $ 147 million , makes [D1] [SS] computer-room equipment [ES] and [SS] vibration-control systems [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] The Watertown , Mass. , company 's sales have been dormant [ES] and [SS] its profits have dropped [ES] [D1]  .
Besides spurring Barry Wright 's sales , which were $ 201.7 million in 1988 , Mr. Sim must pare its [D1] [SS] costs [ES] and [SS] product line [ES] [D1]  .
[D1] [SS] The Butler , Wis. , manufacturer went public at $ 15.75 a share in August 1987 [ES] , and [SS] Mr. Sim 's goal then was a $ 29 per-share price by 1992 [ES] [D1]  .
The stock has since softened , [D1] [SS] trading around $ 25 a share last week [ES] and [SS] closing yesterday at $ 23.00 in national over-the-counter trading [ES] [D1]  .
Reaching that goal , says Robert T. Foote , Applied 's chief financial officer , will require [D1] [SS] efficient reinvestment of cash by Applied [ES] and [SS] continuation of its healthy 19 % rate of return on operating capital [ES] [D1]  .
In Barry Wright , Mr. Sim sees a situation very similar to the one he faced when he joined Applied as [D1] [SS] president [ES] and [SS] chief operating officer [ES] [D1]  in 1985 .
While profitable , it [D1] [SS] was n't growing [ES] and [SS] was n't providing a satisfactory return on invested capital [ES] [D1]  , he says .
He also professes an evangelical fervor to develop a corporate culture [D1] [SS] that rewards managers who produce [ES] and [SS] where decision-making is shared [ES] [D1]  .
Mr. Sim [D1] [SS] considers the new unit 's operations fundamentally sound [ES] and [SS] adds that Barry Wright has been fairly successful in moving into markets that have n't interested larger competitors [ES] [D1]  .
He was [D1] [SS] named chief executive officer of Applied in 1986 [ES] and [SS] became chairman last November [ES] [D1]  .
The company expects that earnings , which have marched steadily upward in recent years , reached [D1] [SS] about $ 20.8 million [ES] , or [SS] $ 1.58 a share [ES] [D1]  , in the fiscal year just ended , up [D1] [SS] from $ 15.2 million in fiscal 1988 [ES] and [SS] $ 3.9 million in 1985 [ES] [D1]  .
